#     - **Financial Health**: Evaluates the liquidity and stability of the MSME‚Äôs finances.
#     - **Credit Reliability**: Considers the consistency and reliability in loan repayments.
#     - **Customer Engagement**: Measures interaction levels with banking products.
#     - **Socioeconomic Stability**: Takes into account the broader economic environment the MSME operates in.
    
#     These components are combined using a mean aggregation to produce a Resilience Score, which indicates the MSME‚Äôs ability to withstand economic shocks. 
    
#     **Thresholds for Resilience Score**:
#     - A score below **-0.5** is considered low, indicating that the MSME may be vulnerable to financial shocks and lacks the financial stability to weather economic downturns.
#     - Scores between **-0.5 and 0.5** are moderate, suggesting that the MSME has some resilience but may need improvements in certain areas.
#     - A score above **0.5** is considered high, indicating strong financial resilience and stability.

    By following the above recommendations:
    
    1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The recommended loan can provide immediate financial resources to invest in critical business areas, such as inventory, equipment, or expansion.
    
    2. **Improved Resilience Score**: A higher resilience score reflects stronger financial health, credit reliability, and stability, making your business more robust against economic shocks and more appealing to investors.
    
    3. **Long-term Planning**: The suggested loan duration and monthly installment align with your income, ensuring manageable payments without jeopardizing cash flow.
        
    **Note**: Always consider your business's capacity to manage loan repayments effectively. While loans can boost growth, over-borrowing may strain financial resources. Use the recommendations as a guide to make informed decisions.
