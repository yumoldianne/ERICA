    - **Credit Reliability**: Considers the consistency and reliability in loan repayments.
    - **Customer Engagement**: Measures interaction levels with banking products.
    - **Socioeconomic Stability**: Takes into account the broader economic environment the MSME operates in.
    
    These components are combined using a mean aggregation to produce a Resilience Score, which indicates the MSME‚Äôs ability to withstand economic shocks. 
    
    **Thresholds for Resilience Score**:
    - A score below **-0.5** is considered low, indicating that the MSME may be vulnerable to financial shocks and lacks the financial stability to weather economic downturns.
    - Scores between **-0.5 and 0.5** are moderate, suggesting that the MSME has some resilience but may need improvements in certain areas.
    - A score above **0.5** is considered high, indicating strong financial resilience and stability.
