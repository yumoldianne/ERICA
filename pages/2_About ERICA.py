#Resilience Score Explanation
st.subheader("Resilience Score")

st.write("""
        The CSR for MSMEs was developed by analyzing various financial and socioeconomic indicators. Transactional and behavioral data were first consolidated into quarterly sums to smooth out short-term fluctuations. Categorical variables were then converted to numeric values through appropriate mapping techniques. After preprocessing the features, correlation-based feature selection was performed to enhance model efficiency, removing variables with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.8 to eliminate redundancy while preserving the most informative indicators.
         
         The framework categorized indicators into four fundamental concepts: `Financial Health`, `Credit Reliability`, `Customer Engagement`, and `Socioeconomic Stability`. Within each concept, the mean of the features was taken and then standardized using z-score transformation to ensure comparability across different measures. These standardized features were then combined through mean aggregation to create composite scores that captured the overall strength of each conceptual dimension.
         
         The final resilience score was computed by taking the average of the four concept-specific composite scores, ensuring equal weight distribution across all dimensions. To enhance interpretability, the resulting score was scaled to a range of 0 to 1 using min-max scaling. This standardized approach produced a robust metric that effectively captures multiple aspects of MSME resilience while maintaining simplicity and clarity in its interpretation.

#Dashboard Components Explanation
st.subheader("ERICA Dashboard")

st.write("""
        ERICA combines the Economic Resilience Score Calculation, Risk Assessment Summary, Target Resilience Score Calculator, Peer Benchmarking, and Resilience Score Predictor to provide insights into a customer‚Äôs financial health and areas for improvement.
         
         The `Economic Resilience Score` aggregates the concepts to create a composite score representing a customer‚Äôs ability to handle financial disruptions. This score is used in peer comparisons to contextualize the customer‚Äôs performance.
         
         The `Risk Assessment Summary` identifies potential financial risks by highlighting areas where the customer‚Äôs scores fall below benchmarks. It provides a quick, color-coded overview of high-risk areas, helping users prioritize improvement actions.
         
         The `Target Resilience Score Calculator` allows users to simulate the impact of changes in the concepts, helping set realistic performance targets. Users can test various scenarios to visualize how adjustments could improve the customer‚Äôs resilience score.
         
         `Peer Benchmarking` compares the customer‚Äôs resilience score and financial metrics against peers in similar Retail and Business Banking groups. This includes two visualizations, a box plot (displays the customer‚Äôs Resilience Score against peer scores), and radar chart (compares the customer‚Äôs performance across the concepts to the peer average, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement).
         
         `Resilience Score Predictor` predicts resilience scores for customers using three different machine learning models.
