    By following the above recommendations:
    
    1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The recommended loan can provide immediate financial resources to invest in critical business areas, such as inventory, equipment, or expansion.
    
    2. **Improved Resilience Score**: A higher resilience score reflects stronger financial health, credit reliability, and stability, making your business more robust against economic shocks and more appealing to investors.
    
    3. **Long-term Planning**: The suggested loan duration and monthly installment align with your income, ensuring manageable payments without jeopardizing cash flow.
        
    **Note**: Always consider your business's capacity to manage loan repayments effectively. While loans can boost growth, over-borrowing may strain financial resources. Use the recommendations as a guide to make informed decisions.
